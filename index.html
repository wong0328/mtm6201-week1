        My name is Fiona, I am currently in the IMD program part time. I am a mom of two boys, named Judah and Micah ages 4, and 7 months old. Being in this program while being a mom of two gets pretty busy and hectic. I also am a Lifestyle Photographer and have been running my business for 3 years now. I started from Winnipeg, and now am based in the Ottawa Gatineau Region. I started photography when I fell in love with landscape photography while traveling and my love for capturing families and couples began as I started exploring different types of photography.
